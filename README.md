Dependencies
============

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [Tailwind-cli](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli)

Running
=======

To run the server on localhost:8000:

```make
make all
```

To compile frontend:


```make
make frontend
```

To run just the backend:

```make
make backend
```

## Deploying to a single server
Using the included dockerfile, create a docker image that incorporates the artifacts generated by `make frontend`. The local registry may be used. Digital Ocean also includes a free tier container registry that may be able to fit a reduced image.

After creating the image, run it in a new container
`sudo docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 -i -t conjecscore:latest python -m uv run fastapi run /code/app/main.py`

This runs the server on port 8000. We can configure nginx to forward-proxy to this service. Its a good deal more hardened than uvicorn, which I believe is running the actual code?
