Dependencies
============

In order to run the website locally, you will need:

- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

`npm` will install [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

`uv` installs various Python libraries, notably [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

`Postgresql` is the underlying database.


Running
=======

You will first need to set up a `.env` file in the `app` directory. That is, you must add a file called `.env` in the `app` directory. The `.env` is used to store environment variables (some of which are secret). Your `.env` file may look something like:

```
SECRET="HELLO"
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=testuser
PGDATABASE=testdb
DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://testuser:password@localhost:5432/testdb"
```

Assuming you use this as your `.env` you must also set up `Postgresql` to work with a user called `testuser`, password called `password` and database called `testdb`. To do so, first run the command `sudo -u postgres psql`. This will log you in as the default user. Then, to create the `testuser`, run:

```
CREATE USER testuser;
```

To create the database run:

```
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

To let the `testuser` have access to the `testdb` run:

```
ALTER DATABASE testdb OWNER TO testuser;
```

This only needs to be done once. After that, in order to start up the website on `localhost:8000`, just run:

```
make all
```
