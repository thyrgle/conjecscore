{% block problem_description %}
  <p>
  The Hadamard Determinant Problem asks what is the maximum value of the determinant of an \(n \times n\) matrix that has entries consisting of only \(\pm 1\). The optimal determinant is known up to \(n = 22\). This problem asks you to come up with a \(23 \times 23\) matrix such that the determinant is as large as possible.
  </p>

{% block submission_format %}
  <p>
  Please submit a CSV file that contains \(23 \times 23 = 529\) values that are either \(\pm 1\). Each group of \(23\) numbers corresponds to a row of the \(23 \times 23\) matrix, call it \(M\).
  </p>
  <p>
  The best score corresponds to the maximizing \(\det(M)\). The score is computed as \(\frac{\det(M)}{10^9}\).
